# Bonks (A Stress Testing Tool for Darknet Sites)
A slow attack that's fired once a second.

Edit following 3 variables with your desired values:  
* url  
* TORPath  
* attackTimes  

The attack is carried out once every second.  
Time taken to complete the whole operation = attackTimes/3600 HRS.  

**NOTE:**  
I wrote these tools for researching ways to Stress Test an onion site (a Darknet / Deepweb / Darkweb site).  
Please use it for research purpose only.  

**Cons:**  
(1) May result in taking down the TOR Network.  
(2) RAM Intensive.  
(3) Written for Windows. Use wine or write your respective .sh/.bash/.py etc. for Linux & others. Logic will be same, only syntax will differ.
